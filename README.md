Solid Subdivision (temp name)
=============================

The following is a compilation of crowdsourced software development best practices: 

* All content is mantained by independent developers that wish to contribute knowledge to the community
* Complete list is available to download from the Github Repository
* We've automated a twitter account (@SolidSubdiv) to post a random short entry every 8 hours. This way devs that do not contribute to the repository can still benefit from the compounded knowledge of the community

Some things to consider when adding new content:
* Every entry needs to contain a short description. This is what will be posted on the tweets
* Every entry must have at least a paragraph explaining the best practice. The content can be hosted using a markdown file on github. This simplifies hosting, and the MD syntax allows for code examples with ease
* If the entry has references to known authors or sources, please include them as a link (in the case of a book, please add reference(s) to where it can be bought)
* We still don't know how to handle multiple language references on each entry (suggestions welcome)

Made with love by people who love sharing knowledge
